# Data Visualization Challenge #

A dynamic and interactive visualization interface to help explore meteorite landings dataset.

The project contains:

* a map

* the meteorite landing dataset (visualized with circle points on the map)

* a tooltip (which presents the data of each meteorite circle point on the map)

* a time range slider (for exploring the time dimension of the dataset)



  Future working step would be clustering..
